            <p>Malo e Lelei! My name is Nanise Lesleyon Vaitohi and I am from Tonga. Tonga is a Polynesian
            kingdom and is one of the small islands located in the South Pacific with a population of over 
            100,000 people. Tonga is known as the "Friendly Islands" a name given by Captain Cook when he 
            visited the Pacific Islands. Tonga was also called the "dot" island. This is because of its
            appearance in the world map as a tiny island with just a dot (.).I am currently a 
            teacher in Liahona High School and started teaching there last year. Teaching was never my goal 
            but I know I have learned so much from this experience. My favorite hobbies are reading, swimming 
            and singing. I have a family and loves to spend time with them in my free time.</p>

            <p>Tonga is a Polynesian kingdom of more than 170 South Pacific islands, many uninhabited, most lined in white beaches and coral reefs and covered with tropical rainforest. The main island, Tongatapu, is protected by lagoons and limestone cliffs. Itâ€™s home to the rural capital of Nuku'alofa, as well as beach resorts, plantations and the Ha'amonga Ê»a Maui, a monumental coral gate from the 1200s.</p>
